This project focuses on developing a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying CIFAR10 images into 10 categories. It involves evaluating the impact of learning rates and applying a learning rate scheduler to improve model performance and generalization. The study also examines the effects of dropout on performance and generalization, and tests transfer learning by freezing convolutional layers while retraining the fully connected layers. Additionally, the project analyzes gradient flow through the network with and without dropout, and with batch normalization, to assess how these techniques affect training stability and overall model performance.
